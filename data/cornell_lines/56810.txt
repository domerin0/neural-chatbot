No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
