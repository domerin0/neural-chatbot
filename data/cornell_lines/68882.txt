You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Oh, that's all.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Bullshit.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
