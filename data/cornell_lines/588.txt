We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
