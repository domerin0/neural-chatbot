This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
