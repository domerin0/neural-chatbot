Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
