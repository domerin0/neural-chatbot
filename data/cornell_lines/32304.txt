Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
You're scarin' me, baby.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
You knew my daddy?
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
How'd you know my daddy?
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
