I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
