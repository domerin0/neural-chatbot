I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
He'll be all right.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
