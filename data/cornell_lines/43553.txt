Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
