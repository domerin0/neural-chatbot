It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
They're over at the booth.
