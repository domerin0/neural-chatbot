Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
