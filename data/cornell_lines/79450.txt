Hey!  You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
