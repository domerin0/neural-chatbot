...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
