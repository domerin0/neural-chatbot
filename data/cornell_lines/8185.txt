If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Fine. Get lost.
