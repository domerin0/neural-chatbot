Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Isn't that your own fault?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
But Jabez, I never said that!
It shows on your face.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
