Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
And the child...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
