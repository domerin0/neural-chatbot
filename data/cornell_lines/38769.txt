Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
... You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
