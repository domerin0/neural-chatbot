I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
