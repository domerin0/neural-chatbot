No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
What if it catches on fire?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
