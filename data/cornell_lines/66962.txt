It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
