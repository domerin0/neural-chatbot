What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
