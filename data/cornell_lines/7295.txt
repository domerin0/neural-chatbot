Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I've heard.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
