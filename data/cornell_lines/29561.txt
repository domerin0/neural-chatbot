What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Tell her... we'll get him.
We won't.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
