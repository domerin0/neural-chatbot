No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
