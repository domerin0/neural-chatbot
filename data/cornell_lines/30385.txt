Whose place is this again?
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
