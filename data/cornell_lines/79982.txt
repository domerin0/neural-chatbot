Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Sally?
She gave me the evil eye.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Well, she...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
You ain't like that no more.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
