Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Case?
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
