I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
