Thanks, miss.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
