Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
