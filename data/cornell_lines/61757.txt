We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
