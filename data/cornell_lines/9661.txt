That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
