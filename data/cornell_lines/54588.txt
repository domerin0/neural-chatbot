... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's great.
What?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
