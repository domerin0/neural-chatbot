What about them?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
