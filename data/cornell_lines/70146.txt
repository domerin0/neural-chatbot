Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
How did you hear this?
He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
