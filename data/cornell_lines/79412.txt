I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Flowers!  What flowers?
