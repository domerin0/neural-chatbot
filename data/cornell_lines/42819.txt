Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
No, brother. What d'you want?
What do I want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
