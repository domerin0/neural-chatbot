No! I won't have him back.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
