I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
