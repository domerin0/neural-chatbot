You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
What expenses?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
