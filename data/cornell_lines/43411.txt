For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
