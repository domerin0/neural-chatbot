What?
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.  The KNIGHTS retreat |  into the darkness of the cave. | |                              GAWAIN |           |      It's only a cartoon. | |                              ARTHUR |      Sh!
