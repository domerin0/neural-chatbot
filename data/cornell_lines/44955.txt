What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Yeah.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
