Hi.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
