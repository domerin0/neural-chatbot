You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
You lie!
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
