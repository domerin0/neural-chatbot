We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What do you mean, help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
