I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
