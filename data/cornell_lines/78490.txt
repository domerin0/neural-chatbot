Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
