Excuse me.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
