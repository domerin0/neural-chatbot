You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Most of the time.
But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
You need a vacation.
Just had one.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
When was the last time you took one?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
How often you go?
Dozen times a day.
