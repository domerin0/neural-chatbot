Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
