Why was the maid crying?
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
