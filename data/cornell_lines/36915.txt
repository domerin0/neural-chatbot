You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I don't.  So, no.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
