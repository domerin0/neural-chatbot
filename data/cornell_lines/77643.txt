And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
