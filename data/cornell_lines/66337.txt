Couldn't have said it better myself.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Murderer?  Really?
