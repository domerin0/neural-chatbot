Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Come on...put his head in place.
