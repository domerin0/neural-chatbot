Where?
Pittsburgh.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
