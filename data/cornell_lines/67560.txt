Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
