Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
