Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Comancheros...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
