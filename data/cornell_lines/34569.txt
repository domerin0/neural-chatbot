Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
