...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
I lied.
All the more reason I should be here.
Please.  It's for your own good.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
