That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You're afraid of him.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
