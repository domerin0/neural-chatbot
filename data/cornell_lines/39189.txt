Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
