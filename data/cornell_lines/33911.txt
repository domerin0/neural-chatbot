--jeeeeeeesus--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.

--what time is it?
