So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
