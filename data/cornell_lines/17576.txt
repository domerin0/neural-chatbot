That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
