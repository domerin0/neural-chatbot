The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I'm going to uphold that.
