Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
