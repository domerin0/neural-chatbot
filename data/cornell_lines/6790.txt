Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
