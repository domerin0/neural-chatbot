This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
