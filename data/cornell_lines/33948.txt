There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Which people?
The ones who could disburse the money.
Who were they?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
