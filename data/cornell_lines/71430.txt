Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
