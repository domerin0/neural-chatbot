Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
