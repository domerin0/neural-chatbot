Are you okay?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
