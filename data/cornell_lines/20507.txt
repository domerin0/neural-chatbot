I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
