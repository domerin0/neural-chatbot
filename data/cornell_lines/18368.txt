What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where does he live?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
Give me the address.
