Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
