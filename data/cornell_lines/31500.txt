A fucking wheelchair?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
