... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Spit from your dad?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Yeah.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
I sure do.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Oh, Jack...
