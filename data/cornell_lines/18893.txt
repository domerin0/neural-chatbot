Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!

No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
