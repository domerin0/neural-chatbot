I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
