Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Sir...?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
I don't understand.
