Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
