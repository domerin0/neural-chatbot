Accident.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
