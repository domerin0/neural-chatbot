All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
