Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Whooee!
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
