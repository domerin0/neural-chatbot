Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
