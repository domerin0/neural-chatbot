At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Think about it!  Just think about it!
