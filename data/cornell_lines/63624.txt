I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
