I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
