What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
