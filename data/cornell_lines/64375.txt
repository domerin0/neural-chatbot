No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
What does Charlie think about that?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
