Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
