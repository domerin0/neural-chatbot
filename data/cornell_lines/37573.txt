All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
