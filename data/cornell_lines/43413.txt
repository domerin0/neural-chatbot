Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
