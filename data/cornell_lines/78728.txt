The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Any idea how much?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
What do you look for?
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Any way we can do it better?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
