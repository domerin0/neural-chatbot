Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Opportunities?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
