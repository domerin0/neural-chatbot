... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Because of my father, I guess.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
