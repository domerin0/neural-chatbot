We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
