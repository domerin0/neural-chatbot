It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
--Darling--
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
