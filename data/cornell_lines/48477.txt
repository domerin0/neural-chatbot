Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
