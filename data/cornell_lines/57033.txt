I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
No, but...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
That's not true...
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
