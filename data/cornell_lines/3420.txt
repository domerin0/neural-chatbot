The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
