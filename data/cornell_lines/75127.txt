Uh-huh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
