'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
