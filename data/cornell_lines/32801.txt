Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
