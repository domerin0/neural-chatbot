You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
