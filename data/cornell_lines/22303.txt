Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
