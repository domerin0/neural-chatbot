Dad!
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Who won the fight?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Yeah.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
