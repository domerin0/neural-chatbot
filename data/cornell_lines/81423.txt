You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
