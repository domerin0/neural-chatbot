Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
