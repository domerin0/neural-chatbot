I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Oh, man.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Sounds great.
