Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
