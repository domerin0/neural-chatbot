When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
How many men?
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
