Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
