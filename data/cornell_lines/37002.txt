He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
But he's never said a word-
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
