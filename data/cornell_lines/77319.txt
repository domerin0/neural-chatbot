We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
