This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
