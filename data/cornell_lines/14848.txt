Can I ask you about Melanie?
Sure.
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
She believed you?
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
