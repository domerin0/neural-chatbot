Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
