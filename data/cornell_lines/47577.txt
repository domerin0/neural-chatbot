Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
