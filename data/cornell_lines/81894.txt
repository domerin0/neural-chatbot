I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You didn't cuff her?
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
