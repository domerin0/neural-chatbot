We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
