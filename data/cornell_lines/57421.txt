There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
