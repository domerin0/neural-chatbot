Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.

But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
