Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
No, I didn't.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Yeah, so?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
