What kind of gun is that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
How close do you have to be?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
