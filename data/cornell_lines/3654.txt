Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I have heard of them.
