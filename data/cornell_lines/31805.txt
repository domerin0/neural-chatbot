It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
...I understand...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
