"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
