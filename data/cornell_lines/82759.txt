You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
