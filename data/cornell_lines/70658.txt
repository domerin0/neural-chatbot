That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Well...
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
