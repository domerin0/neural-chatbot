Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
