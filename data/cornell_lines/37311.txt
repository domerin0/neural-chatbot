I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I am sorry you feel that way.
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
