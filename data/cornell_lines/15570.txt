My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
