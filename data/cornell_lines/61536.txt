So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
So how do I start?
The game will guide you.
