Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Trial?  What trial??
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
The English??
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
