There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
