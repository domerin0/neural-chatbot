How come you stay 'round here?
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
That's why you come back, huh?
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Scared, huh?
