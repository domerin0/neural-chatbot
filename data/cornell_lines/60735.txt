Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Will I be able to walk?
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
