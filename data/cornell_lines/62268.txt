You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
That's little egotistical.
