Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
What if I take you with me?
If you take anybody, please take me.
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
