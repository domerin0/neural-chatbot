Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
