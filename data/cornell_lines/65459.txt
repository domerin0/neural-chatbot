You're upset, huh?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
You liked the guy, though.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
