We stood here once before.
I know -- Teresa -—
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
