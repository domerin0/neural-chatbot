Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
No, I'm not...
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
