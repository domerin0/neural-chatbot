I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
It's just a thought.
