... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.

That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
