That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
