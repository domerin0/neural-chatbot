No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
