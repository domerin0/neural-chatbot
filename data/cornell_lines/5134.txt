The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
