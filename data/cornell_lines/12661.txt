Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
It's like telling fibs.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
