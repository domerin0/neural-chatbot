You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
