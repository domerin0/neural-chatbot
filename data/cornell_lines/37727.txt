... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
