What's the matter?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
