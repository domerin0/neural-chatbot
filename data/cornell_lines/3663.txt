The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
