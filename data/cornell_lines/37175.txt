All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
