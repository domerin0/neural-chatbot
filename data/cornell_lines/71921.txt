I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
Not any more!
