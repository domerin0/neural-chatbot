Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
