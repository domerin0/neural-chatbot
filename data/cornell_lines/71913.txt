Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
