Anne, come here. Listen—
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Are you crazy?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
