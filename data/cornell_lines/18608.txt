Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Right.
