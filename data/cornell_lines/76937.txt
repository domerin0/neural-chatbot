I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
