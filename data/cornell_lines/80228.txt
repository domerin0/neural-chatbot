Hi, Mickey ...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Uh ...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
