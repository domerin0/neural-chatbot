I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
