No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
