It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.

Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
