Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
