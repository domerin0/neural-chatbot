I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
How many did you lose?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
