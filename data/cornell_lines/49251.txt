I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Yeah, so what happened?
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
