As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
