Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
