Michael, are you still in bed?
No.  I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
