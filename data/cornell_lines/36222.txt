Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
