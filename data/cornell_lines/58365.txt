Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
I've seen 'em.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
He squeezed money out of you?
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
And my father?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
People didn't complain?
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
