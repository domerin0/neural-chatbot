Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
You know the Jedi Master?
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
