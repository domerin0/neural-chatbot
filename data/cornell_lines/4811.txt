Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Okay honey.
