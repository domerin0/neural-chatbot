This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
It never crossed your mind?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
