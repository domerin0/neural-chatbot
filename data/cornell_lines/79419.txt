Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
