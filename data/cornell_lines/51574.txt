That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
