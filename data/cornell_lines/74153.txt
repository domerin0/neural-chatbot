I...don't think so.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
What happened?
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
