Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Why?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do you believe in?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
That's why we're here.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
