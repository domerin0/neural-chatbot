I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
