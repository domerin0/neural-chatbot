Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Christ, can't you hear it?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Doesn't it matter to you?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Because I can hear it.
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
