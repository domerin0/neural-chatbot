Yeah?
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
