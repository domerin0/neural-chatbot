The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael...
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
