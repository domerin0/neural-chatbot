Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
