Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
