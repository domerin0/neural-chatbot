What's he like?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
I volunteered.
You volunteered?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
