Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
I - I - I...
Understand?  I'm sorry.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
