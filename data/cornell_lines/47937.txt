Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
