He's not treating her right...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
We were together six years, sir!
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
