You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
