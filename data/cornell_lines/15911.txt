Did you see his face?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
