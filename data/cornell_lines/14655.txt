You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
