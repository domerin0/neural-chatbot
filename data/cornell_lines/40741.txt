What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
