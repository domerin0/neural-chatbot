Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Well... is it so urgent?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
