Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
You were more like brothers.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
...He said that?
