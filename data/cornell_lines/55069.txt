I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
How do you know this shit?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Good thinking Marge.
