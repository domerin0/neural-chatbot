What'd you fight, middleweight?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
Flyweight.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You're not my type.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Just a minute.
