Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
