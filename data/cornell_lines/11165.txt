He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Yeah? How?
