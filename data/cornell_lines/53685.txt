For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
