Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
They would?
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes -- that's true.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
