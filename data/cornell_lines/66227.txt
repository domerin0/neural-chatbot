Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
