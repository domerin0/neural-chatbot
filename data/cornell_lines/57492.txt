You ever think about getting married again?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
How many onions does it say to use?
Three.  And add some basil.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
No.  I don't think so.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
