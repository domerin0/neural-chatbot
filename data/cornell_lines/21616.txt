...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
