There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
