Stay off it.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
You weren't there.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
