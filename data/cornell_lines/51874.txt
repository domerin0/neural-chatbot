If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
