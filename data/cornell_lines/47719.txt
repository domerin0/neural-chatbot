ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
