You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
