If looks could kill, I'm dead...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
