The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Of course, Nick...
