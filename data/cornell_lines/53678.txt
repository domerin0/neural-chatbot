What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Nothin'.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
