Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Really, that's a long time.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
