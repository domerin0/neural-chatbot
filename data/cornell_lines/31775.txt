Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
