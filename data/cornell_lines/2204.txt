Oscar, what's the matter?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
Yeah.
