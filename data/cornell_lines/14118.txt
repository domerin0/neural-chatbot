Hello.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
When should we do this?
