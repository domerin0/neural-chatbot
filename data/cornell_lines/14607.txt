Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
