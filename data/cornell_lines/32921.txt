Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
