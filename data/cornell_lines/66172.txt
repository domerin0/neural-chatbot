Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
I... I'll get the grits.
