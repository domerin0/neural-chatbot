Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
