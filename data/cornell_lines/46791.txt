Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
