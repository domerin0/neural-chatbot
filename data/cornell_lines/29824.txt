So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
