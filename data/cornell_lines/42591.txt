It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Actually, that's his night job.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
