Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
And your principles?
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
