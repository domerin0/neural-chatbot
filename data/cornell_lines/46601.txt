That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
