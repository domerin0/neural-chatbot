The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
That's right.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
