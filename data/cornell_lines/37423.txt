Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
No, Jane.
You'll be rich!
We're rich in what really matters.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
