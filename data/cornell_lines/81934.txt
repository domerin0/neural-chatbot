Kelly...
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
