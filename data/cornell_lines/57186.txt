All these in the last year?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I could always apply there.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
