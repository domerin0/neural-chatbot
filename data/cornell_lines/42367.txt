I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Susan!
