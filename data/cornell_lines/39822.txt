Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Er, yes ...
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
