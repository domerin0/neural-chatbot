That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Is that all?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
