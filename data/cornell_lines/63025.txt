Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
He's full of shit.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
