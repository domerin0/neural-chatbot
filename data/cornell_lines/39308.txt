Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
