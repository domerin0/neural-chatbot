You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
