Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Who do you think did it?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
